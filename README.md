# ChartJS Vue Example

## UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Purpose

The [ChartJS package](https://www.chartjs.org/) is a terrific way of displaying data charts. And, there is even a [Vue plugin](https://vue-chartjs.org/) for using it. However, I have found the [documentation on ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) to be time-consuming to understand. There are many options and many ways of modifying a chart, but no central reference for the chart data and options.

This project will include examples and a master reference of the options.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
